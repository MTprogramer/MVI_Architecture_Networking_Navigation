/*  Why Use Channel Instead of Flow for Navigation Events?
    What‚Äôs the Difference?
   Flow:
       A stream of values emitted over time, typically used for continuous state updates (e.g., UI state like postState).
       Observers (e.g., collect) receive all values emitted while active, and it‚Äôs stateful by nature (e.g., StateFlow holds the latest value and when UI recompose for any reason it again hit navigation).
       Best for persistent data that the UI reflects continuously.
   Channel:
        A mechanism for sending one-shot, discrete events (e.g., "navigate now").
        A Channel is a queue of events, not a state holder. When you send an event It‚Äôs queued and consumed once by the collector (e.g., collect { ... }), then gone.
        Avoids recomposition issues because it doesn‚Äôt hold a current value‚Äîevents are transient.
        Acts like a queue: events are sent and consumed once, not replayed unless explicitly configured means if event consumed once never effect anywhere until new event is not fired  (e.g., with Channel.RENDEZVOUS or CONFLATED).
        Converted to a Flow with receiveAsFlow() for collection, but retains its event-like nature. */

/*   Channel.RENDEZVOUS:
              Capacity 0, suspends sender until receiver is ready‚Äînot ideal for navigation due to delays when UI isn‚Äôt collecting.
     Channel.UNLIMITED:
              Unlimited capacity, queues all events‚Äîpoor for navigation as it stacks screens with every click.
     Channel.BUFFERED:
              Default 64 capacity, suspends when full‚Äîunsuitable for navigation due to queuing and potential suspension.
     Custom (e.g., Channel(1)):
             User-defined capacity, suspends when full‚Äîinefficient for navigation as it queues events and delays sender.
     Channel.CONFLATED:
              Capacity 1 with conflation, keeps only the latest event and never suspends‚Äîperfect for navigation as it ensures the most recent intent is processed once without stacking or delays. */

/* üîπ Does ViewModel Fit MVI Rules?
            ‚úÖ Yes, if used correctly
            ‚ùå No, if misused (e.g., mutable state inside ViewModel)

  How to use ViewModel in MVI correctly?
            ViewModel as a Bridge (Not a State Holder)

            It acts as an Intent processor that collects UI events (Intent), processes them, and exposes State to the UI.
            It should not hold any mutable state inside it.
            State Management in ViewModel

           Use StateFlow (or LiveData) to expose a single source of truth to the UI.
           Keep state immutable.
           Business Logic Should Stay in Use Cases/Repository

          ViewModel should only process intents and delegate business logic to Use Cases or Repository.
          Use ViewModel for Surviving Config Changes

          Since ViewModel survives configuration changes, it can help maintain the current state without needing to restore it from scratch. */
